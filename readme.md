# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple to-do list web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Optional: Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Optional: [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Open the index.html file:**

    - **Using a Web Browser:**

        Simply double-click the `index.html` file in your project directory, and it will open in your default web browser.

    - **Using Visual Studio Code with Live Server extension:**

        If you have Visual Studio Code installed along with the Live Server extension, you can right-click on the `index.html` file, select "Open with Live Server", and it will open the application in your default web browser.

    Alternatively, you can use a local server to serve the files. For example, if you have Python installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

    Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

## Usage

- **Complete a Task:** Click the radio button next to the task to mark it as completed.
- **Delete a Task:** Click the "Delete" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
